SportsGame demo

This demo shows a typical use for Resolution Magic for a static game area, in this case a sports court.

This should be tested with landscape resolutions. If you view it with a portrait ratio you will see bright pink areas that represent content outside the background.

A hard border is set around the canvas, which is itself fits the shape of the green court area. Some balls bounce around and collide with the hard border.

Click the blue arrow button to flip gravity and watch the balls hit the upper border.

Changing the zoom type to MaxSize will show more of the orange background area, where 'nice to have' content can go, such as spectators. 
You would implement this by deciding to zoom to the Canvas or MaxSize depending on the screen size/resolution being used at runtime.
